          <h3 class="home-title mb30">A place to talk about menopause.</h3>
          <p>
            We want to create a site that supports women before, during and after the menopause. A site which is not filled with dry, impersonal, medical facts but which shares expert advice, authentic voices, interviews, fashion and is funny, frank and kind
          </p>
          <p>
            We started this because people need it, there is nothing else like this out there, and we know from first hand experience that many women donâ€™t know what to expect, feel alone and feel unrepresented in the media
          </p>
          <p>
            We have already spoken to over fifty women at all stages of the menopause and they have spoken about feeling embarrassed and alone. They have used words like &#8216;loss&#8217; and &#8216;taboo&#8217;.  In almost every case they have been surprised by what are very common symptoms.
            We want to change this.
          </p>

          <h3 class="home-title mb30">What&#8217;s the name all about?</h3>

          <p>
            The menopause is often described &#45; shamefacedly and elliptically as &#8216;the change&#8217; or &#8216the time of life&#8217;.
          </p>

          <p>
            We want to embrace the change. This is often a time when you pause and consider your life, when you are at the peak of your earning potential or are in a powerful position.
          </p>

          <p>
            We want to turn the embarrassment round and challenge the taboos that often come with the menopause.
          </p>

          <p>
            We don&#8217;t want you to have the &#8216;time of life&#8217;. We want you to have the time of your life.
          </p> 

          <h3 class="home-title mb30">Why have we invited you here?</h3>

          <p>
            You have been invited here because we would like you to be one of the founding contributors. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We hope that you recognise that the site will be stylish, well designed and will be a place for irreverent, supportive, fresh and philosophical content that will help millions of women have the time of the lives.
